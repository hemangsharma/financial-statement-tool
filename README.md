# financial-statement-tool

## Key Features
1. Automated Data Ingestion – Connects to accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero, SAP, etc.), Excel, or databases to pull relevant financial data.
2. AI-Based Categorization – Uses machine learning to categorize transactions (e.g., revenue, expenses, liabilities).
3. Statement Generation – Creates Balance Sheets, Income Statements, and Cash Flow Statements with AI-powered insights.
4. Customizable Reports – Users can customize formats, add comments, or tweak calculations.
5. Compliance Checks – Ensures financial statements adhere to GAAP, IFRS, or other relevant standards.
6. Anomaly Detection – Flags unusual transactions or potential accounting errors.
7. Forecasting & Analysis – Provides AI-driven predictions on future financial health.
8. Integration with Auditing Tools – Helps in compliance audits by organizing data efficiently.

## ROADMAP

### Define the Scope & Features
Before diving into development, decide:
- Target users – Small businesses, accountants, freelancers, enterprises?
- Core features – Automated report generation, compliance checking, forecasting?
- Integrations – Accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero, etc.), databases, Excel?

### Tech Stack Selection

Backend (Data Processing & AI)

- Python (Pandas, NumPy) – For data wrangling
- SQL / NoSQL (PostgreSQL, MongoDB) – For storing financial data
- Django / FastAPI / Flask – To build APIs
- AI/ML Frameworks:
    - Scikit-learn (for classification, regression models)
    - TensorFlow/PyTorch (if deep learning is needed)
    - OpenAI API / LLMs (for NLP-based financial insights)

Frontend (User Interface)
- React.js / Vue.js – For a smooth UI experience
- Dash / Streamlit – If you prefer a Python-based UI
- Chart.js / D3.js / Plotly – For financial visualizations

Cloud & Deployment
- AWS / GCP / Azure – For scalable hosting
- Docker & Kubernetes – For containerization
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) – For automating deployment

Data Sources & Ingestion
You need financial data to generate statements. Possible data sources:
- APIs – QuickBooks, Xero, SAP, Plaid, Open Banking APIs
- CSV/Excel Uploads – Users may upload raw financial data
- Manual Input – A web form for users who don’t use accounting software

Use ETL pipelines (Airflow, dbt, Pandas) to clean and structure the data.

### AI/ML Components
Your AI engine can handle:
- Transaction Classification – Using ML to categorize expenses, income, liabilities
- Anomaly Detection – Finding unusual financial patterns (fraud, errors)
- Financial Forecasting – Time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet) for predicting trends
- NLP-Based Insights – AI-generated explanations for financial data

### Compliance & Security
- Ensure Compliance – GAAP, IFRS, local accounting laws
- Security Best Practices – Encrypt sensitive financial data (AES, TLS)
- User Authentication – OAuth, JWT for secure logins

### MVP Development & Testing
Start with an MVP (Minimum Viable Product):
- Basic version: Accepts financial data, classifies transactions, generates a simple balance sheet
- Iterate: Add automation, AI-based insights, and compliance checks over time

### Deployment & Scaling
Once tested, deploy on AWS/GCP/Azure with Docker & Kubernetes for scalability.

### Next Steps

- Start with data ingestion & processing – Build an ETL pipeline first
- Experiment with AI models – Try classifying transactions and forecasting revenue
- Develop a simple UI – Even a basic Streamlit app can help test early ideas
- Get user feedback – Early testing with real accountants or businesses
